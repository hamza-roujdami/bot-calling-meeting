## üéØ **Two Architectural Approaches**

### **Approach 1: Traditional Multi-Service Architecture**

**Stack:**
- Application-Hosted Media
- Separate: Azure Speech STT + GPT-4 + Azure Speech TTS
- Custom audio processing pipeline

**Pros:** More control, can optimize each component  
**Cons:** Complex, high latency (2-3s), expensive development (6-8 weeks)

**Estimated Development Cost**: $25,000 - $40,000  
**Monthly Operating Cost**: $500-700

### **Approach 2: GPT-4o Realtime API** ‚≠ê **Recommended**

**Stack:**
- Application-Hosted Media (for Teams audio access)
- **GPT-4o Realtime API** (single API for STT + AI + TTS)
- Simplified audio pipeline

**Pros:** 
- Faster development (2-3 weeks)
- Lower latency (320ms)
- Natural conversation
- Built-in context awareness

**Cons:** 
- Dependent on single API
- Newer technology (preview stage)

**Estimated Development Cost**: $12,000 - $20,000  
**Monthly Operating Cost**: $300-400

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Platform Deprecation Notice**

### **Microsoft Bot Framework SDK Deprecation**

Microsoft has officially **deprecated the Azure Bot Framework SDK as of August 11, 2025** and is transitioning to the **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK**.

**Impact on Our Project:**

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Current Bot** | Built on Bot Framework SDK v4.x (deprecated platform) |
| **Support Timeline** | Limited extended support, no new features |
| **Required Migration** | To Microsoft 365 Agents SDK for long-term viability |
| **Migration Complexity** | üü° Medium (2-3 weeks additional effort) |
| **Migration Timing** | Recommended within 6-12 months |

**Official Announcement**: [Bot Framework to Agents SDK Migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/bf-migration-guidance)

**Recommendation**: 
- **Short-term**: Complete current implementation on Bot Framework (works for 1-2 years)
- **Mid-term**: Plan migration to Microsoft 365 Agents SDK in 2025 Q4 or 2026 Q1
- **Alternative**: Build new features directly on Agents SDK (longer initial timeline)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Platform Update**

### **Microsoft Bot Framework SDK Deprecation**

**Effective Date**: August 11, 2025 ([Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/bf-migration-guidance))

**Impact**:
- Current bot built on deprecated Bot Framework SDK
- Microsoft recommends migration to **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK**
- Extended support available but limited timeframe

**Recommended Actions**:

1. **Near-term** (Next 3-6 months):
   - Complete voice AI features on current platform
   - Bot remains functional for 12-18 months

2. **Mid-term** (Q4 2025 or Q1 2026):
   - Plan migration to Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
   - Budget: $10,000 - $15,000
   - Duration: 2-3 weeks

3. **Alternative**:
   - Build new features directly on Agents SDK
   - Longer initial timeline (add 2-3 weeks)
   - Future-proof from the start

**My Recommendation**: Complete on Bot Framework now, migrate to Agents SDK in Q4 2025. This balances speed-to-market with long-term platform stability.

**Option A**: Full voice AI (Bot responds to "Hey Bot" during calls)
- Duration: 4 weeks
- Cost: $15,000 - $22,000
- Complexity: High
- Result: Complete voice interaction

**Option B**: Transcription-based AI (Bot responds to @Bot in chat)
- Duration: 2 weeks  
- Cost: $8,000 - $12,000
- Complexity: Medium
- Result: Context-aware but chat-triggered

**Option C**: Hybrid (Start with B, add A later if needed)
- Phase 1: 2 weeks ($8K-12K)
- Phase 2: 4 weeks ($12K-18K)
- Total: 6 weeks ($20K-30K)
- Benefit: Can validate Phase 1 before committing to Phase 2

### **2. Platform Strategy**

**Option A**: Build on current Bot Framework, migrate later
